# Pending Tasks

## Performance: Chapter Cursor Navigation
Instead of listing all chapters on the book page, implement a cursor-based navigation that shows only the current chapter. Some books have many chapters which can cause slow page loading.

**Current behavior:** All chapters listed on book show page
**Desired behavior:** Show current chapter with prev/next navigation

## Feature: Keyword Search for Resume
Allow users to search for a keyword within a book to jump to a specific passage. This is useful when a user has been reading on another device (e.g., Kindle) and wants to resume typing from where they left off.

## Feature: Sample Book
Add a short sample book so new users can quickly test the app without needing to upload their own EPUB file.
