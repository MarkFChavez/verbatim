# TODO

- The url for typing mode is /passages/:id. It's possible that user takes a shortcut by changing the URL directly.
- After each passage, we should display the typing results first. I feel like users don't want to keep continuing, most of the time they want to rest a bit and look at the results -- but allow them to press [Enter] to resume passage.
